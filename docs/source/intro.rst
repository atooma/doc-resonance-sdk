Getting Started
=======================================

This tutorial is intended to get you up and running with the Resonance Android SDK environment. We'll walk through from setup to running your own **Resonance-Powered-App**.

**Resonance-Powered-Apps** are Android based applications or devices that allow a user to leverage on the power of connecting multiple devices and apps together, with the final goal to automate recurring tasks and actions.

You'll be also able to leverage on our predictive and real-time suggestion based APIs which will provide a full context aware experience towards your end users.

Furthermore sensors, apps and devices are all managed by Resonance as key enabler to new generations of smart devices designed to:

* **Listen** to people’s behavior across apps and devices.

* **Act** accordingly with the desired action in the right moment for a magic experience.

* **Analyze** the patterns and get the most out of them.


What We Believe?
-----------------------------------------------------

Within 2020 the number of connected devices will be over than 50 Billion.
From Connected Cars to Smart Homes, from Wearables to Smartphones all things are getting connected and more intelligent everyday.

Android is entering into Photo-Cameras, Car Infotainment Systems, Smart Home Hubs rather than Smartphones.
Anyhow, such devices are still far from each other - they do not talk - they do not provide cool and useful cross-use-cases to end users. How many of you are using a Smart TV, not only to watch TV programs? How many of you are considering useful a smartwatch device after the first week of adoption?

As result, end users got lost among different OSs and Devices Capabilities turning their connected and smart experience into a nightmare.
Resonance bring again the user at the centre of the picture, seamlessly connecting devices around him and providing real context aware and predictive aware features.

Developers and Companies focused on building IOT devices and/or Apps can rely on a perfect tool to empower their products capabilities and turning them into a real context aware space.

What Is Resonance - Why There Is An Atooma App On The Market?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Atooma App was born initially as an Android (recently also on a light-version for iOS) application aimed to allow end users to create and share automation rules following the *IF and DO* paradigm.

So, using Atooma App users are able to create rules like: *IF I'm running and I plug the headphone DO Launch the music* or *IF I'm driving back to home and my battery level is below 10% DO send an SMS to my wife*.

Today more than 25M of rules have been created and shared among our community and hundreds of apps and devices features are controlled by the Resonance Rule Engine.

Building our own App and product has been a perfect strategy to understand what people love to automate in their life. What they are looking to turn smart into their devices or apps and why they found even hard to use a toolkit like our consumer App.

What Is Resonance SDK?
-----------------------------------------------------

Such enormous validation convinced our team to extend such contextual capabilities not only to the end user’s hands but directly towards device vendors and app developers team.

Imagine to be able to connect your temperature sensor to our engine and being able to enable contextual experiences on your Smart Home App like: *Every Time the temperature threshold is below a certain level and I'm out of home, activate the air conditioning and store the electrical consumptions info into a Drive Doc*. Well, using the Resonance SDK, you can do it in a matter of seconds!

We estimated every developer can save up to *60%* of coding lines to build context aware use cases by relying on our SDK.

We do provide to third party developers a full standalone Android Rule Engine intelligence together with a set of embedded modules to start immediately to build automation use cases just by matching basic lines of XML scripts.
On top of it developers have the opportunity to create their own sensors modules and plug them with our engine or just simply connect their devices to the Resonance Cloud and leverage on real time prediction based rule suggestions.

We do provide external developers a set of APIs which leverage on the fact that Resonance is able to collect user's behaviors information among hundreds of sensors and apps with the final result to be able to to let your App be aware of what the user is going to do. Imagine to have an API able to let you know if the user is driving back home from work or just simply to understand if the user is in a Bus rather than a Car.
Having such contextual information then you'll be able to proceed by coding a specific reaction on your own app or eventually leverage on the Resonance Rule Engine to be able to trigger an automation rule based on such context prediction.
