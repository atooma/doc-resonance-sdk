=========================================

Welcome to the official reference for developing with Resonance SDK powered by Atooma.

.. note::

	This documentation is a work in progress. We are working hard every day for providing all of you an awesome developer experience, so stay tuned!

	Documentation sources are available on `GitHub <https://github.com/atooma/doc-resonance-sdk>`_, so if you find typos, errors, or think something can be communicated better, fork repository and make a pull request.

	We appreciate your understanding and patience!

This documentation is aimed to provide in depth details on how to approach development and it is organized as follows:

* :ref:`intro` - Here you can find answers to questions like *what is Resonance?* and *what can I do with Resonance SDK?*. Your understanding of Atooma potential starts from here!

* :ref:`core` - Interested in Atooma SDK? Great! First step is to go deep into this section for understanding main concepts concerned with Atooma environment and platform.

* :ref:`xml` - Defining complex rules with Atooma is extremely simple and doesn't require to write a huge amount of lines of code. It's enough to have a basic knowledge of XML and check our :ref:`reference` for creating awesome automations.

* :ref:`programming` - Atooma SDK already provides many sensors but... what if this is not enough? If you need additional features you can simply create them!

* :ref:`reference` - Here it is our API reference, providing details on all modules that are currently available with Atooma SDK. You can exploit all of them for building your great applications!

* :ref:`commons` - Here are described classes and utilities included in Atooma Commons Library. Its purpose is providing  a ready to use implementation for useful features and functionalities.

* :ref:`activity` - Interested in Resonance? Great! This section provides advanced details on Atooma solutions for dealing with complexity of *Activity Tracking*. Everything starts from here.

* :ref:`resonance` - This section provides low level details on how to effectively exploit Resonance SDK.

* :ref:`examples` - This sections provides some examples, showing how Atooma simplify development. Focus on core features of your application and let Atooma do the rest!

* :ref:`example` - Let's move to practice! In this section you can find some Resonance SDK usage examples, showing how it can dramatically simplifying development of killing features within your app!

* :ref:`releases` - Here is reported changelog as well as list of stable packages to use!
